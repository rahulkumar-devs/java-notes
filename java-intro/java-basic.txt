------Programing Language------
programming language is a set of instructions and syntax used to create software programs.
 Some of the key features of programming languages include

 hello.java ---------> compiler (hello.class) byte-code ---------> JVM machine (convert into machine code) ;

 JVM --> (Java virtual machine) is an abstract machine that enables computer to run a java progra . 
 actually jvm present inside the JRE which is actual a physical machine.
 When java Program run , java compiler first complies java code to byteCode.
  then JVM translate byteCode into native machine code (set of instructions that a computer's CPU execute directly)
